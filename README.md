# Mobile-Graphical-Interface-Programming
Mobile devices play an instrumental part of everyday life, thus requiring knowledge of mobile graphical user interface development. Students explore graphical user interface programming in a mobile Android environment. Students learn how to program applications using the latest Android development tools. Topics include application architecture, interface design, network communication, and database integration.
1. Develop a graphical user interface-based program, given design documents using object-oriented programming, structured programming, top-down coding, and event-driven coding.
2. Produce tested code that executes correctly and consistently.
3. Test code using iterative testing of GUI program components, valid data only, invalid data only, a combination of valid and invalid data and set wise refinement involving users.
4. Prepare program documentation using prescribed program specifications
5. Debug program problems using manual and programmatic methods
6. Access and modify a database table from within the graphical user interface.
7. Create GUI programs that support internationalization as well as sustainability.
8. Collaborate in a team to complete complex assignments
9. Use local and remote Git repositories to perform version control of a program, including use of branches when working with other developers.
